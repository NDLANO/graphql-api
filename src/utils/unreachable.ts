/** Function to make sure all cases of a type is handled.
 *  Compilation will fail if code is reachable with other type than never.
 *
 *  This example will fail because the 'two' case is not handled.
 *  But once a 'two' case is added to the switch it will compile successfully.
 *  Example:
 *  ```
 *  type SomeUnion = 'one' | 'two'
 *  function handleUnion(x: SomeUnion): boolean {
 *    switch(x) {
 *      case 'one':
 *        return true;
 *      default:
 *        unreachable(x);
 *    }
 *  }
 *  ```
